Installation instructions for htmlToPDF

The TCPDF files are part of this package.

Upload all files inside the assets folder to your web-space. The lib folder
already contains a htacces file, that disallows every call from the web.

If you want a logo in the page header, you have to upload the logo the folder
assets/lib/tcpdf/images/. This is because TCPDF only uses this folder, to
look images files.

Create two new snippets:
htmlToPDF       -> assets/snippets/htmlToPDF/snippet.htmlToPDF.php.tpl
getCurrentDocID -> assets/snippets/htmlToPDF/snippet.getCurrentDocID.php.tpl

No create the chunks, that you want to use in your snippet calls. You may create
different chunks for different websites, if you use htmlToPDF in different
templates.
Open the templates, where you want to use htmlToPDF and add the call to the
chunk at the top of the template. Here is an example of a call:
[!htmlToPDF? &author=`Stefanie Janine Stoelting` &tvKeywords=`documentTags` &headerLogo=`logo.png` &chunkContentFooter=`pdf-contentfooter` &chunkStandardHeader=`pdf-header-text` &chunkStyle=`pdf-style`!]

For further information about the snippet parameters read the documentation in
parameter-descriptions.html.

The file assets/snippets/htmlToPDF/chuncks/pdf-link.txt contains a chunk to
generate a link for the PDF download. If you place the call outside the content,
the link to the PDF call is not part of the PDF document.
