This MODx snippets uses TCPDF, available at http://www.tcpdf.org/, to create the
PDF Files from the content of a web document, published with MODx. TCPDF will be
part of the packages, that will be available beginning with the first beta
version.

The main goal is to create highly configurable PDF documents. This is possible
with a lot of parameters, that one can use on a call and the usage of chunks.
All chunks make use of the placeholders as defined in other MODx snippets.

For the installation you need to upload the TCPDF in the directoy:
assets/lib/tcpdf/
The snippet classes should be located at:
assets/snippets/htmlToPDF/

Create a new snippet with the source of snippet.hmtlToPDF.php and call the
snippet within your templates, probably at the top of the template.
For the snippet call you can add several chunks as templates. Examples are in
the assets/snippets/htmlToPDF/chunks/ directory.

Here is an example for a call to htmlToPDF:
[!htmlToPDF? &author=`Stefanie Janine Stoelting` &tvKeywords=`documentTags` &headerLogo=`logo.png` &chunkContentFooter=`pdf-contentfooter` &chunkStandardHeader=`pdf-header-text` &chunkStyle=`pdf-style`!]
